## ‚ú® Overview

The **Nexus Learning Platform** is an advanced e-learning application built to solve key challenges in online education. It provides a robust, secure, and intuitive environment for students, teachers, and administrators.

The platform moves beyond standard course delivery by implementing two core features:

* **Time-Gated Progression:** A "rolling window" of accessible chapters paces students, encouraging mastery before they can proceed. The window only advances after a user has completed all chapters within it and a 24-hour timer has elapsed. This unique system ensures students thoroughly engage with the material.
* **Collaborative Administration:** Multiple teachers can co-manage published courses, view analytics on user engagement and enrollments, and handle course publishing workflows, making it a powerful tool for educational organizations.

## üíª Development Commands

* **Run the local development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
* **View the database locally with Prisma Studio:**
    This command opens a visual editor for your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma studio
    ```
* **Modify the Database Schema:**
    When you change your `schema.prisma` file, you must first update the Prisma Client, then push the changes to your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma db push
    ```

## üìö Managing Course Categories

You can add new course categories using two methods.

### Standard Method (Recommended)

1.  Open the **Supabase Dashboard** > **Table Editor**.
2.  Select the **Category** table.
3.  Click **"Insert Row"**.
4.  For the `id`, generate a random UUID using an online generator.
5.  Add the `name` for the category and save.

### Developer Method

1.  Configure the `scripts/seed.ts` file to add or change course categories.
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node scripts/seed.ts
    ```
3.  Use `npx prisma studio` to verify that the categories have been added.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is optimized for and deployed on **Vercel**. For the best performance and to avoid potential issues with custom domains, it is recommended to use a **dedicated domain** rather than the default `.vercel.app` URL in a production environment.
